      <p>Main, or propulsion, engines are used to turn the ship's propeller 
          and move the ship through the water. They typically burn diesel oil
           or heavy fuel oil, and may be able to switch between the two. 
           There are many propulsion arrangements for motor vessels, some 
           including multiple engines, propellers, and gearboxes.
